# TuxPay

TuxPay is a self-hosted, non-custodial payment processing server for cryptocurrencies. TuxPay provides the facilities to automate payments in an E-commerce environment, or to simply act as an invoicing/payment solution for a business.

TuxPay utilizes the existing network of public ElectrumX servers - this allows you to monitor incoming payments for multiple coins without requiring your own full nodes or relying on a custodial service. For those with more business critical requirements you can also point your payment server at your own private or trusted ElectrumX servers.
